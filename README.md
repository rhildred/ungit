[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ungit.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/ungit)

The easiest way to use git. On any platform. Anywhere.

 * Clean and intuitive UI that makes it easy to _understand_ git.
 * Runs on any platform that node.js & git supports.
 * Web-based, meaning you can run it on your cloud/pure shell machine and use the ui from your browser (just browse to http://your-cloud-machine.com:8448).
 * Works well with GitHub.
 * [Gerrit](https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/) integration through plugin: https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit-gerrit

Installing
----------
Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org) (≥ 0.10), [npm](https://npmjs.org/) (≥ 1.3.1, comes with node.js) and [git](http://git-scm.com/) (≥ 1.8.x). To install ungit just type:

	npm install -g ungit

NOTE: If your system requires root access to install global npm packages, make sure you use the -H flag:

	sudo -H npm install -g ungit

Using
-----
Anywhere you want to start, just type:

	ungit

This will launch the server and open up a browser with the ui.

Configuring
---------
Put a configuration file called .ungitrc in your home directory (`/home/USERNAME` on *nix, `C:/Users/USERNAME/` on windows). Can be in either json or ini format. See source/config.js for available options.

You can also override configuration variables at launch by specifying them as command line arguments; `ungit --port=8080`. To disable boolean features use --no: `ungit --no-autoFetch`.

Example of `~/.ungitrc` configuration file to change default port and enable bugtracking:

```json
{
	"port": 8080,
	"bugtracking": true
}
```

Ungit uses [rc](https://github.com/dominictarr/rc) for configuration, which in turn uses [optimist](https://github.com/substack/node-optimist) for command line arguments. See corresponding documentations for more details.

Plugins
-------
Plugins are installed by simply placing them in the Ungit plugin directory (`~/.ungit/plugins` by default), and then restarting Ungit.

[List of available plugins](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit/wiki/List-of-plugins)

There's a guide in the [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md) file on how to write new plugins.

Developing
----------

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Known issues
------------

* If you're running MacOSX Mavericks and Ungit crashes after a few seconds; try updating npm and node. See [#259](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit/issues/259) and [#249](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit/issues/249) for details.

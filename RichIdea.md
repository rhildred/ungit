Software Development is a Cooperative Game ... Play it on Ungit
===============================================================

Hi Fredrik:

I am super stoked about your way of re-visualizing git. I am using it with students at Conestoga College, Ontario, 
where I am a Professor. I am also a big fan of Alistair Cockburn's idea of [software as a cooperative game.](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Cooperative+game+manifesto+for+software+development). I would like to make an uneclipse based on an idea like ungit and Cockburn's idea. A bit like cloud9 but less like eclipse then that is as well as more git focused. I am curious about how you came up with the UI for ungit, which is awesome by the way.

I have read Bret Victor's [learnable programming](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/), and Will Wright [Sims, BattleBots, Cellular Automata God and Go](http://www.gamestudies.org/0102/pearce/). I am wondering how you came up with such a good visualization of something that most of us use every single day.

thanks

Rich
